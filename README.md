A transliteration tool for Old Church Slavonic (Old Bulgarian) and Old Russian. Supports Old Church Slavonic font face and transliterates between Cyrillic, ISO R9, ALA-LC, HIP and UCS.

## About
This transiteration tool was initially published in 2014 on [podolak.net](https://podolak.net/en/transliteration/old-church-slavonic) and later on the [Danish Portal for Slavonic, Balkan and East European Studies](https://oesteuropastudier.dk/en/tools/transliteration/old-church-slavonic). As I do not have the ressources to maintain the code anymore, I have decided to publish the code to anyone under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://github.com/pod-o-mart/CyrAcademisator-OCS/blob/main/LICENCE.md)-licence.

Although the code is quite messy, it works without problems. There were no complaints on wrong transliterations, the different transliteration styles seem to be in order.

## Installation
Just copy all files to a folder on your server/webspace and point to it with your browser. The script is ready-to-go.
